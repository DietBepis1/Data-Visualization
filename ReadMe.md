This is a visualization/data science project from Python Crash Course 2nd Ed, by Eric Matthes to get familiar with matplotlib and data manipulation with Python. I will be using Python 3.7.4 and Python 3.8.0, installed on my desktop and laptop, respectively

Build log:

    -Started the project but unfortunately only got the first plot done.
    -Having an issue getting vscode to import matplotlib on my laptop, which is Python 3.8.0. Will note when resolved.

    -Played around with a scatter plot. The first couple scripts of this project will just be random files to get familiar
    with matplotlib.  I'll save these in a separate folder if I don't need them later.
